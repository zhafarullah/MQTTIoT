# Humidity Control for Books
## Introduction
Unstable humidity conditions are one of the main causes of book damage. High humidity can cause book pages to wilt for hours and turn yellow. Conversely, an environment with too low humidity can cause paper to become brittle. These uncontrolled conditions require Humidity Control that is not only able to control humidity automatically, but can be monitored remotely in real-time.
