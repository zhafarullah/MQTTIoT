# Humidity Control for Books
## Introduction
Unstable humidity conditions are one of the main causes of book damage. High humidity can cause book pages to wilt for hours and turn yellow. Conversely, an environment with too low humidity can cause paper to become brittle. These uncontrolled conditions require Humidity Control that cannot only control humidity automatically but can also be monitored remotely in real-time.

This project aims to create a device that controls the humidity where the book is stored. The prototype device is a box equipped with 2 fans on the left and right sides, each acting as an inlet and outlet for air. This fan can rotate automatically based on humidity and can also be manually controlled via the dashboard.
